# AikyaNova Labs Embedded Systems - ESP32 QC Testing

This repository provides AikyaNova Lab’s standardized Quality Control (QC) test firmware for ESP32 development boards. These tests are used internally by AikyaNova Labs during hardware validation and incoming quality control (IQC), and are also shared with customers so they can independently verify the ESP32 hardware they receive.

The QC process is divided into **Phase One** (Physical) and **Phase Two** (Functional/Firmware).

## What is an ESP32? 

### Overview of ESP32 SoC
The ESP32 is a highly integrated, low-cost system-on-chip (SoC) developed by Espressif Systems, combining a dual-core 32-bit microcontroller with built-in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (Classic + BLE) connectivity. Clocked up to 240 MHz, it offers strong processing capability, flexible GPIO multiplexing and a rich set of peripherals including ADC, DAC, PWM, UART, SPI, I²C and CAN. Multiple low-power modes enable energy-efficient designs, while hardware security features such as secure boot, flash encryption and cryptographic acceleration make the ESP32 suitable for both prototyping and production-grade embedded and IoT applications.

## ESP32 DevKit Overview

The ESP32 DevKit is a development and evaluation board built around the ESP32 SoC. It exposes the ESP32’s GPIOs, power rails, and communication interfaces through standard headers, enabling rapid prototyping, firmware development and hardware validation.
AikyaNova Labs uses ESP32 DevKit boards as the reference platform for QC testing, ensuring consistent and repeatable results across batches.

## Quality Control (QC) Overview

AikyaNova Labs follows a repeatable and customer-verifiable QC process to ensure ESP32 boards meet electrical, functional, and wireless performance expectations.

Incoming QC (IQC) verifies physical condition, connectors, power integrity, and basic electrical behavior.
Functional QC validates firmware upload, USB-serial communication, GPIO operation, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth functionality using standardized test firmware.

- **Phase 1:** Physical and Power Checks
- **Phase 2:** Functional & Connectivity Checks
  
To run the firmware tests (Phase 2), you must set up your software environment. We recommend the Arduino IDE due to its ease of use.

## Setting up the Arduino IDE

1. Install Arduino IDE
   - Download and install the latest Arduino IDE for your OS (Windows, macOS or Linux) from:
   https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

2. Add ESP32 Board Support
   - Open Arduino IDE and go to File > Preferences.
   - In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, paste the following link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

3. Install ESP32 Board Support
   - Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager.
   - Search for "esp32".
   - Install the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" package
    
4. Select Board & Port
   - Board: Go to Tools > Board > ESP Arduino > ESP32 Dev Module
   - Port: Go to Tools > Port and select the COM/USB port where ESP32 is connected
   - Upload Speed: 921600 (recommended) or 115200
   
## USB Driver Installation
If your computer does not recognize the board (no COM port appears), you likely need to install the USB-to-UART bridge driver.
- CP210x Driver: Download from [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) (Common for DevKit V1/DOIT boards).
Tip: If you are unsure which chip your board uses, look at the small square black chip near the USB port. The text on it will usually say CP2102 or CP2104.

## Included Test Firmware

- `Blink_LED`: LED and basic GPIO checks.
- `ESP32_QC_WIFI_AP`: Wi-Fi Access Point mode test.
- `ESP32_QC_WIFI_STA`: Wi-Fi Station mode test.
- `ESP32_QC_Bluetooth_Android`: Bluetooth validation by Android pairing.
- `ESP32_QC_Bluetooth_IOS`: Bluetooth validation by iOS pairing.

## QC Phases

  - Phase 1: Physical & Power Checks
    + Board condition and enclosure inspection
    + USB port sturdiness & connectivity
    + Power-on validation
    + GPIO pins check
    + Buttons click test
      
  - Phase 2: Functional & Firmware Checks
    + GPIO and USB-Serial Communication Validation (Blinking LED)
    + Wi-Fi Testing (Access Point & Station mode)
    + Bluetooth Testing (Classic/BLE testing using mobile devices)
   
## QC Workflow

Recommended Test Sequence
1. Power ON and verify USB-serial detection
2. Upload and run Blink_LED firmware
3. Execute Wi-Fi tests (AP → STA)
4. Execute Bluetooth tests (Android / iOS as applicable)

Record **PASS/FAIL**

## Troubleshooting Guide

 Board Not Detected
  - Check USB cable (data cable required)
  - Verify correct COM/USB port selection
  - Install appropriate USB-to-UART driver (CP210x / CH340)
  - Try a different USB port or system

 Upload Failures
  - Ensure correct board is selected in Arduino IDE
  - Hold BOOT button (if present) during upload
  - Reduce upload speed if errors persist
  - Close other applications using the serial port

Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Failures
  - Verify antenna is not damaged or obstructed
  - Avoid metal enclosures during testing
  - Ensure only one board is powered during RF tests
  - Check serial logs for connection errors

Common ESP32 Pitfalls
  - Insufficient USB power causing brownouts
  - Using restricted GPIOs unintentionally
  - Expecting stable Wi-Fi performance in noisy RF environments

## Safety and Handling
  - Do not exceed recommended voltage levels
  - Avoid hot-plugging external peripherals
  - Use reliable USB power sources
  - Avoid repeated force on USB connector

## Notes

- These tests are designed for hardware validation, not production firmware.
